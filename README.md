‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This is *not* the official Baysor repository. This is a modified fork, humorously named **Bejsor**, which includes a **stupid workaround** to reduce excessive RAM usage when running Baysor on high-transcript-count datasets (e.g., Xenium 5K+ panels).

It is meant for **experimental use only** and should not be considered a reliable alternative to the [official Baysor repository](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor). Use at your own risk.

## What is Bejsor?

**Bay**esian **E**xperimental **J**anky **S**egmentation **o**f spatial t**r**anscriptomics data

This is a lightly modified version of [Baysor](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor) with:

- The **local NCV color estimation step disabled** to mitigate RAM issues
- Minor tweaks for CLI usability and config overrides
- Everything else untouched from upstream

The name *Bejsor* reflects that this is **not production-ready**. It‚Äôs a playground version to try out tweaks that may (or may not) work on large datasets.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT the Official Baysor

If you're looking for a maintained and production-ready tool for segmentation, you should use the official Baysor:
