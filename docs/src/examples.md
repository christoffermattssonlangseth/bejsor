# Examples

For examples of segmentation on different protocols, see the [`examples`](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor/tree/master/examples) folder:

- [STARmap](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor/tree/master/examples/STARmap)
- [ISS](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor/tree/master/examples/iss)
- [osm-FISH](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor/tree/master/examples/osm-FISH)

Also, [`configs`](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor/tree/master/configs) folder can be helpful. Particularly, it has [the config](https://github.com/kharchenkolab/Baysor/blob/master/configs/xenium.toml), which works for most of the Xenium datasets.
